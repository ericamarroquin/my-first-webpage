  <h1>All about Munchie the Cat</h1>
  <p>Munchie is a precious trash cat, found screaming in the garbage bins
    next to my home. He is orange and white and big-boned by no fault of
    his own.</p>

  <h2>Here are a few things that Munchie likes.</h2>
  <h3>People</h3>
  <p>Munchie is very friendly and loves humans, but he has his favorites.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My stepdad</li>

    <li>Literally anyone else</li>
    <li>Me, only when all the above are unavailable and I'm very busy</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Foods</h3>
  <p>A picky cat he is not, but here are a few of his favorites:</p>
