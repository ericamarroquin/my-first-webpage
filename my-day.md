# My day

## How exciting is being a new programmer?
So exciting! Each day I learn something new and get to talk to cool people about it, too. 

### Here are the new things I learned today:
- CSS styling
- Git branching
- Git merging
- Markdown

We did a lot today - what I used most was `git commit`. I always make sure to credit my co-author! I've pair-programmed with two classmates thus far.
