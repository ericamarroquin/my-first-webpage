  <h1>My favorite places</h1>
  <p>I have many places that I <em>love</em>
    to spend time. Here, I'll list some of them.</p>
  <h2>The beach</h2>
  <p>I grew up visiting my aunt where she lived on the beach in
      Babylon, NY. To get there, we would have to cross an old bridge called
      the Robert Moses bridge. Check out its complicated history
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Island_Inlet_Bridge">
      here</a>!
  </p>
  <h2>Upstate, NY</h2>
  <p>After going to school in Ithaca, NY, and living there for a couple years,
      the area really grew on me. My friend owns a home there, so I get to visit
      often!
